    PANIC Engine Checklist

    - Make certain things optional when loading block / entity files
        - Collision
        - Offsets

    - Get EntityEntry hooked up to PANIC.Entities

    - Make some fun new blocks

    - Create a CollisionBox that works with EntityEntrys

    - A Lighting handler

    - Logger that queues logs and batch logs them

    - Using new input methods create a custom controls handler
        - The reason for this is so instead of making multiple event handlers, just have one main one that responds

	- Swap directions, North is -Z, South +Z, West is -X, East is +X

	- PANIC.Packages Offload scripts in to "Packages" that are dynamically loaded with dependies when needed

	- Figure out the best way to light the scene so entities and the blocks all look good.
